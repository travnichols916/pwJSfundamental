## Installation


The code for this assignment was utilizing Javascript considering HTML and CSS files were provided. The JS script began with assigning code including a query selector with a selector for generate.
There was then an array with each of the characters that were being used for the file including lower case, upper case, numbers and special characters. The process involved the adding an event listener, the utilization of console log to alert the user of the password length between 8 and 128 characters.

The next section covered the different confirmation prompts which asked if the user wants lower case, upper case, numbers or special characters generated in their password. Then what followed was the different options and the loop for random selection which included a method for obtaining different characters.



## Usage

Screenshots including the character list and the loop for random selection were provided.
